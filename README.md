# IllumioCodingChallenge
For testing the solution, I created a test file and tested a few examples. I believe I covered most of them and would have tested with more test cases if I had more time.

I believe the algorithm and the data strctures that I have used are quite efficient and would have liked to add some error handling.

Overall, I had fun doing the assignment.

I am very interested in the Data team and would like to know more about the team and the current projects that are being worked on.
